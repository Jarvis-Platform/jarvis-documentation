# Execute code processings with VM Launcher

##  ðŸ’¡ What is VM Launcher?

A VM Launcher \(VML\) code operation allows you to execute any program in any language, like python, R, Javascript, etc. on a virtual machine launched and stopped  automatically  by Tailer.





A Tables to Tables \(TTT\) data pipeline operation allows you to automate the execution of one or several BigQuery tasks in order to extract, transform and load data from tables to other tables.
