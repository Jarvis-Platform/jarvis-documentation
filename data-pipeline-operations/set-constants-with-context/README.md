# Set constants with Context

## üí°What is Context?

A Context data operation allows you to set constants that you will be able to use in other data operations.

Constants are objects which act as placeholders to a memory location where their value is stored.

## ‚úÖ Supported data operations

All data operations can contain the constants set with Context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

You set a constant as follows through a Context data operation:

```text
"test_integer": {
			"value": 123456,
			"type": "integer",
			"resource": "value",
			"description": "Some random value"
		}
```

Once you have deployed your Context data operation, you can start using the constants it contains in your other data operations with the following syntax:

```text
{% myConstant %}
```

## **üìã How to set and use a constant**

1. Access your **tailer** folder \(created during [installation](../../getting-started/install-tailer-sdk.md)\).
2. Create a working folder as you want, and create a JSON file for your Context data operation inside.
3. Set all the required constants in your JSON configuration file. Refer to this page to learn about all the [parameters](context-configuration-file.md).
4. Access your working folder by running the following command:

   ```text
   cd "[path to your working folder]"
   ```

5. To deploy the Context data operation, run the following command:

   ```text
   tailer deploy configuration your-file.json
   ```

6. Log in to [Tailer¬†Studio](http://studio.tailer.ai/) to check the status and details of your data operation.
7. You can now use your constants in other data operation configurations files using the `{% myConstant %}` syntax.

For  STS, STT, TTT and TTS data operations, you need to add`"version" : "2"`to the JSON configuration file be able to use Context constants.
